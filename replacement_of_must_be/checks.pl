check_that/3 and friends: a replacement for the must_be/2 predicate of 
Prolog. must_be/2 is used to check preconditions on predicate entry, but
is not very flexible. Can we change that?
 
See: https://eu.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/doc_for?object=must_be/2
 
A call to check_that/3 looks as follows:

   check_that(X,Conditions,ThrowFlag)

where

   - X is the term that is subject to being checked.
   - Conditions is a proper list of conditions to be evaluated left-to-right
   - ThrowFlag is a flag that determines whether to, in certain settings, 
     preferentially throw (if it is =|true|= or =|throw|=) or fail
     (if it is anything else, including an unbound variable)

The simpler

   check_that(X,List)

assumes that Throw is =|false|=.

The more extensive

   check_that_named(X,Conditions,Name)
   check_that_named(X,Conditions,Name,Throw)
 
also takes a Name to designate the X that is being checked. The Name can then
be inserted into exception messages. Generally one would not bother with this.

The list of conditions
----------------------

The list of conditions behaves like a "conditional and" (aka. "short-circuiting and")
of verifications. A condition is a compound term, a tagged check. The functor name
of the condition specifies what to do depending on the outcome of the check.

The "check precondition fails" generally means that the actual check cannot determine from the current
state of X whether to reasonably succeed or fail because X is not instantiated enough. The check would
then raise an instantiation exception (in the current implementation, a non-ISO exception term
error(check(not_instantiated_enough,_,_,_),_).

The Prolog default checks like atom/1 take the high way and fail in that case (atom(_) fails, either
pretending to know something about _ that it doesn't or outing itself as a second-order predicate
like var/1 that can analyze the momentary state of the computation and say that a term is indeed
uninstantiated. In either case, it's dubious practice).

The Prolog behaviour can be recovered with the tag smooth/1. However, it is preferred to use 
another tag and to explicitly check for var-ness and earlier (to the left in the list of
conditions) and accept it (e.g. break(var)) or reject it (e.g. nonvar(X)).

The behaviour is as follows for the various tags allowed in conditions:

break/1

- Check precondition fails: 
  An exception (generally a 'uninstantiated error' exception) is thrown.
- Verification fails:
  The condition succeeds, leading to examination of the next condition to the right.
- Verification succeeds:
  Condition processing stops and check_that succeeds overall

smooth/1

- Precondition fails: 
  The condition fails, leading to the whole of check_that/N failing. 
  This is like the behaviour of prolog predicates like atom/N when
  they are given an uninstantiated term: They just fail.
- Verification fails: 
  The condition fails, leading to the whole of check_that/N failing. 
- Verification succeeds:
  The condition succeeds, leading to examination of the next condition to the right.

soft/1

- Precondition fails: 
  An exception (generally a 'uninstantiated error' exception) is thrown.
- Verification fails: 
  The condition fails, leading to the whole of check_that/N failing. 
- Verification succeeds:
  The condition succeeds, leading to examination of the next condition to the right.

tuned/1 and the "Throw" flag is unset: behaves like soft/1

- Precondition fails: 
  An exception (generally a 'uninstantiated error' exception) is thrown.
- Verification fails: 
  The condition fails, leading to the whole of check_that/N failing. 
- Verification succeeds:
  The condition succeeds, leading to examination of the next condition to the right.

tuned/1 and the "Throw" flag is set: behaves like hard/1

- Precondition fails: 
  An exception (generally a 'uninstantiated error' exception) is thrown.
- Verification fails: 
  An exception (generally a 'type error' if X is out-of-type, and a domain error if X is 'out of domain') is thrown.
- Verification succeeds:
  The condition succeeds, leading to examination of the next condition to the right.
  
hard/1 

- Check precondition fails: 
  An exception (generally a 'uninstantiated error' exception) is thrown.
- Check verification fails: 
  An exception (generally a 'type error' if X is out-of-type, and a domain error if X is 'out of domain') is thrown.
- Verification succeeds:
  The condition succeeds, leading to examination of the next condition to the right.
 
Synopsis:

  Fail if X is not a string

     check_that(X,[tuned(string)])

  Throw if X is not a string

    check_that(X,[hard(string)])

  Throw if X is not an integer and then fail if X is not a positive integer

    check_that(X,[hard(int),tuned(posint)])

  Or you can switch "lenient" to behave "strictly":

    check_that(X,[hard(int),tuned(posint)],throw)

  Fail if foo is not a member of the given list with a supplementary argument:

    check_that(foo,[tuned(member([alpha,bravo,charlie]))]).

  Throw if foo is not a member of the given list (it would really cool if
  one could inject the source code line into the message; that can be done
  with term_expansion I think. Maybe later)

    check_that(foo,[tuned(member([alpha,bravo,charlie]))],throw).
    ERROR: check failed : domain error: "the culprit is outside the required domain"
    ERROR:    message   : "the value should fulfill 'list-member-ship-ness'"
    ERROR:    culprit   : foo

Usage scenarios:

  - Use check_that/2 to verify predicate entry preconditions
    - Expecting to switch them off at "production time" (assertions) to gain performance
    - They are also goo "live documentation" saying exactly what parts of the input space are covered by throws and which ones by fails
      One can rely on "implicitly building" that space via the behaviour of the predicates called in turn, but may become unclear
      what that space is. (This may be ok depending on coding style)
    - Using check_that/2 "normally" as a guard to make the predicate
      - throw on extremely bad arguments (i.e. badly typed ones)
      - fail on bad arguments (i.e. out-of-domain ones)
     - Logic/Search parts of the program will preferentially fail (or only enter the situation where a fail makes sense)
     - Functional programming parts of the program will preferentially throw (or only enter the situation where a throw makes sense)
  - Use check_that/2 to verify invariants inside of predicates (generally not needed as this is done by checking pre/postconditions in Prolog)
    - Expecting to switch them off at "production time" (assertions) to gain performance
    - TODO: Such cases must be marked as "this is not expected to be violated in running code" (throwing a really nasty exception)
      And then the test must be switch-offable using a specific hierarchical key, just like you switch logging on or off that way.
  - Use check_that/2 normally in code, as just a particular form of a guard, i.e. it is not expected that they will be switched off
  - (There is no easy way to perform postconditions-on-success in Prolog except by wrapping a predicate with another predicate. Annoying.)

Assertions

  - Assertions are basically the subset of conditions that one does not expect to fail or throw at runtime.
    The idea is to remove those tests because they "never fail" and the insurance will pick up the slack if they do.
    Prolog is special in that "failing" is an integral part of its approach, so switching off checks wholesale is not an option
    (Unless one wants to really have separate instructions for "necessary checks" and "assertion checks")
    To "remove unnecessary checks" it must both be possible to:
    1) identify them. This can be done my giving them a special name, e.g. lenient_assert instead of just lenient
    2) be able to "remove them" cheaply; this can be done during compilation phase: the marked conditions can be written out
    3) select those which should be removed based on program structure: eg. all those in module XY should be removed
       this also seems a case for the compilation phase

Desgin question especially clear in case of complex checking of lists:

  - The structure to test may have multiple layers of testing. For example, for a "proper list of char":
    - X is a var             -> fail or exception
    - X is not a proper list -> fail or exception
    - X contains vars        -> fail or exception
    - X contains non-chars   -> fails or exception
    - and finally success
    A caller could demand throwing down to any level of the above (and possibly accept var)
    The **proper way to have this flexibility** is exactly to use check_that/2 with the detailed
    more-and-more-precise check sequence, going from strictness to leniency depending on taste, for example
      check_that(X,[break(var),hard(list),hard(list(nonvar)),tuned(list(char))])
    instead of a single monolitic
      check_that(X,[break(var),hard(chars)])
    However, in that case the "rightmost checks" may perform wasteful checks against that we already
    know will succeed. So there is a need for doing bare-bones checks (maybe?). Probably not worth it.
    Note that what exception to throw is generally made in this order:
    X uninstantiated -> throw instantiation error
    X instantiated but not of the correct type (e.g. expecting integer but it's a float) -> throw type error
    X of the correct type but not in the correct domain (e.g. expecting positive integer but it's negative) -> throw domain error

Note that eval generally fails (or throws, if so demanded) if the question is "about" an uninstantiated variable.
However, passing an uninstantiated variable is actually a different level in that the question posed by the
predicate is "ill-formed" (e.g. is "_" an atom? cannot be answered (there is not enough information) unless one
considers this is a second-order question, in that "unbound variables" become themselves the object of discourse;
in which case "second-order: is an unbound variable an atom" can be answered with 'false'). Anyway, should ill-formed
questions _really_ be answered with failure/standard-throw or with an unconditional throw of a dedicated exception?
I am unsure about this. For, it's "as usual".

The Check is either an atom or a compound term from the following list of atoms and compound terms (aliases are indicated with "/")

  Ok float                   : passes float/1 (in SWI-Prolog, an IEEE 64-bit float)
  Ok rational                : a non-integer rational or an integer
  Ok number                  : passes number/1
     between(FloatL,FloatU)  : if FloatL is float, all other values may be float or integer (FIXME?); the limits are both INCLUSIVE; limits may be equal but NOT reversed
     between(IntL,IntU)      : if IntL is integer, all other values must be integer; the limits are both INCLUSIVE; limits may be equal but NOT reversed
                            FIXME: there should be specific between_int/2 and between_float/2 if one goes that way.
  Ok acyclic                 : passes acyclic_term/1, i.e. is an acyclic term; includes unbound var (the term is a tree if one disregards "internal sharing")
  Ok cyclic                  : passes cyclic_term/1, i.e. the term contains cycles (the term is a "rational tree"). Does not accept an unbound variable.
  Ok char                    : atom of length 1
  Ok chars                   : list of 1-character atoms; includes the empty list

  Ok string                  : passes string/1, an SWI-Prolog string
     text                    : atom or string or chars or codes (but not numbers even though some predicates "textify" those)
  Ok var                     : passes var/1; must be an unbound variable
  Ok nonvar                  : passes nonvar/1; anything except an unbound variable
  Ok list,proper_list        : passes is_list/1 and is a proper/closed list; empty list is allowed
     list(Type)              : proper list with elements of type Type (must_be/2(Type,_) is called on elements); empty list is allowed;
                               on error the index is not indicated (why~~~). A type like "list(list(integer))" is ok!
     list_or_partial_list    : A partial list (one ending in a variable: [x|_]). This includes an unbound variable.
     callable                : passes callable/1. Relatively usesless, as "callable" is ill-defined. Basically (atom(X);compound(X))
  Ok dict                    : passes is_dict/1, an SWI-prolog dict (which is just a compound term of a particular form)
     encoding                : valid name for a character encoding; see current_encoding/1, e.g. utf8 (but not "utf8" or 'utf-8'; also fails for 'iso_8859_1')
  Ok stream                  : passes is_stream/1, is a stream name or valid stream handle
     type                    : Meta: Term is a valid type specification for must_be/2. This is done by looking up whether a clause `has_type(Type,_) :- ....` exists.
                               Example: must_be(type,list(integer)). However, "must_be(type,list(grofx))": OK, but "must_be(type,grofx)": NOT OK.
Possible extension:

  predicate_indicator     : A Name/Arity predicate indicator
  nonempty_list           : A list that is also nonempty
  list_length_X           : Tests for length of lists (larger, smaller, equal)
