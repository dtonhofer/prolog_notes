For "anytext", see [this page](https://eu.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?section=string-predicates).

Also take a look at the comments for atom_length/2.

## Replacement

[Here is simple code](https://github.com/dtonhofer/prolog_code/blob/main/unpacked/onepointfour_basics/doc/README_stringy_length.md) for a common =|stringy_lengthâˆ•2|= which refers to atom_length/2 and string_length/2 as needed. This already happens, but there is still this troubling naming specificity, which I would like to get rid of.
