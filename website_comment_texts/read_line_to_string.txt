## Example

Can be used to ask the user as a proper replacement for read/1

```
ask_user :-
   format("You must answer 'yes' to accept this offer one cannot refuse!~n"),
   read_line_to_string(user_input,S1), 
   string_lower(S1,S2), 
   (
      member(S2,["yes","1","ok","y","ja","oui"])
      -> format("You may proceed, good citizen.~n")
      ;  format("I am sorry to hear that.~n"), fail
   ).   
```

Then:

```
?- ask_user.
You must answer 'yes' to accept this offer one cannot refuse!
|: yes
You may proceed, good citizen.
true.
```
