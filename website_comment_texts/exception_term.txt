## More info

I'm trying to keep [**this page**](https://github.com/dtonhofer/prolog_notes/blob/master/swipl_notes/about_exceptions/README.md) updated with info on Prolog exceptions.

It also explains why I really _do not like_ the ISO Standard exception term. Here
is hoping for a v2 exception term in the future (hopefully in ... ECMAProlog?)

## About the backtrace

How do we get a backtrace and how does the exception term have to look to get one?

The backtrace is filled in according to SWI-Prolog conventions because the ISO Standard has nothing to say about this.

SWI-Prolog wants the second argument of the `error/2` term (given in the ISO standard as `Imp_def`) to look like
`context(Location,Message)`. If `Location` is fresh and the catch is performed by catch_with_backtrace/3
(which happens either explicity in code or at the latest possible time at the Prolog Toplevel),
then `Location` is filled with a backtrace (as implemented by `library(prolog_stack)` in
file `swipl/lib/swipl/library/prolog_stack.pl`). The Message is generally a cleartext message (string or atom).

Take this program:

==
call0(ExceptionTerm) :-
   call1(ExceptionTerm).

call1(ExceptionTerm) :-
   call2(ExceptionTerm).

call2(ExceptionTerm) :-
   throw(ExceptionTerm).
==

Enable debugging to keep the compiler from optimizing-away stack frames.

==
?- debug.
==

Let's study the behaviour of "backtrace generation" by `catch_with_backtrace/3` with various forms of `ExceptionTerm`. We will let the
exception be caught at the Prolog Toplevel, which uses that predicate.

**Non-ISO-Standard exception term without placeholder**

No backtrace is generated, there is minimal printing at toplevel:

==
?- call0("deep in a search tree").
ERROR: Unhandled exception: "deep in a search tree"
==

**Quasi-ISO-standard exception term `error(_,_)`**

An exception term that looks like `error(_,_)` matches the ISO Standard basic format, although the requirements
regarding the formal term on the first position have to be followed too for full compliance.

The second argument is set to `context(B,_)` where `B` contains a backtrace.

The toplevel tries validly to print something in the first line, but has to admit that it found an `Unknown error term`:

==
[debug]  ?- call0(error("deep in a search tree",Context)).

ERROR: Unknown error term: "deep in a search tree"
ERROR: In:
ERROR:   [13] throw(error("deep in a search tree",_4126))
ERROR:   [12] call2(error("deep in a search tree",_4156)) at user://1:14
ERROR:   [11] call1(error("deep in a search tree",_4186)) at user://1:11
ERROR:   [10] call0(error("deep in a search tree",_4216)) at user://1:8
ERROR:    [9] <user>
   Exception: (13) throw(error("deep in a search tree", _3266)) ? Exception details
==

Asking for "exception details" using `m` reveals that `Context` has been filled in with a
term `context(prolog_stack(Frames),_)` as the exception term looks as follows:

==
error("deep in a search tree",
      context(
         prolog_stack([
            frame(13,call(system:throw/1),throw(error("deep in a search tree",_4126))),
            frame(12,clause(<clause>(0x1a7ef30),4),call2(error("deep in a search tree",_4156))),
            frame(11,clause(<clause>(0x1a9ccd0),4),call1(error("deep in a search tree",_4186))),
            frame(10,clause(<clause>(0x1a368c0),4),call0(error("deep in a search tree",_4216))),
            frame(9,clause(<clause>(0x18f7450),3),'$toplevel':toplevel_call(user:user: ...))]),_4082))
==

**Quasi-ISO-standard exception term with SWI-Prolog context term `error(_,context(_,_))`**

The same as above, we just have SWI-Prolog specific `context/2` subterm already in the
ISO-standard specific `error/2` term.

We can put a generic message in the second argument of `context/2`. In this example, a String:

```text
[debug]  ?- call0(error("deep in a search tree",context(_,"get me outta here"))).
ERROR: Unknown error term: "deep in a search tree" (get me outta here)
```

**ISO-standard exception term with SWI-Prolog context term `error(IsoFormal,context(_,_))`**

As above, backtrace and all, except that now error message generation is correct as it is based on the
list of valid ISO formal terms:

==
[debug]  ?- call0(error(instantiation_error,context(_,"get me outta here"))).
ERROR: Arguments are not sufficiently instantiated (get me outta here)
ERROR: In:
ERROR:   [13] throw(error(instantiation_error,context(_3028,"get me outta here")))
ERROR:   [12] call2(error(instantiation_error,context(_3064,"get me outta here"))) at user://1:14
ERROR:   [11] call1(error(instantiation_error,context(_3100,"get me outta here"))) at user://1:11
ERROR:   [10] call0(error(instantiation_error,context(_3136,"get me outta here"))) at user://1:8
ERROR:    [9] <user>
==
