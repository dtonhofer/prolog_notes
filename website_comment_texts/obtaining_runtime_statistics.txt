There is some functionality for statistics which is hard to find in the manual.

This chapter, [**Obtaining Runtime Statistics**](https://eu.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?section=statistics), lists the following predicates:

   - statistics/2 - a built-in predicate
   - statistics/0 - a predicate from =|library(statistics)|=
   - time/1       - a predicate from =|library(statistics)|=

The fact that the predicates are part of =|library(statistics)|= is shown in the header of the page, but the corresponding link directs back to [Obtaining Runtime Statistics](https://eu.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?section=statistics), not to =|library(statistics)|=

=|library(statistics)|= does not show up in the search bar, but can be found as:

[=|library(statistics)|=](https://eu.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/doc/_SWI_/library/statistics.pl). 

The lead-in text says: 

> The predicates of this library are for human use at the toplevel: information is _printed_. 

It provides the following, two of which are listed above

   - statistics/0 (as seen above) ; [alt documentation link](https://eu.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/doc_for?object=prolog_statistics%3Astatistics/0) - Printout for the user
   - statistics/1 - Collect **all** performance values into a dict for further processing
   - thread_statistics/3  
   - time/1 (as seen above)  ; [alt documentation link](https://eu.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/doc_for?object=prolog_statistics%3Atime/1) - Time a goal, printout for the user
   - call_time/2 
   - call_time/3 

The chapter, [**Execution Profiling**](https://eu.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?section=profile) is separate and lists further predicates provided by =|library(statistics)|=:

   - profile/1
   - profile/2
   - show_profile/1
   - profile_data/1
   - profile_procedure_data/2
