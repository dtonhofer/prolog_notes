## Explainer

The following file that is basically an explainer of how I organize & load modules and unit tests.

It is also a Prolog program, that when executed, does exactly that (for my setup).

[`load_and_test_script.pl`](load_and_test_script.pl)

## Code is in the process of being moved

The code is being moved to the github repository [prolog_code](https://github.com/dtonhofer/prolog_code)

That repository features a [separate directory](https://github.com/dtonhofer/prolog_code/tree/main/packed) with SWI-Prolog "pack" files.

The README at the top of the moved code tree is [here](https://github.com/dtonhofer/prolog_code/blob/main/unpacked/onepointfour_basics/README.md)
