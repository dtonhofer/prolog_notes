The [Flora-2 Manual](http://flora.sourceforge.net/docs/floraManual.pdf) (PDF), _Chapter 20: Negation_ (p 86 ff.) explains the
extensions of Flora-2/XSB relative to Prolog:

> Flora-2 supports three kinds of negation: a _Prolog-style negation_ `\+`; _default negation_ based
> on _well-founded semantics_, denoted `\naf`; and explicit negation `\neg`, which is analogous
> to what is called “classical” negation in \[Classical negation in logic programs and disjunctive databases\].

The manual describes the problem of `\+` in the context of `\naf` (note a different syntax whereby
variables are the tokens which start with a `?`, not the tokens with star with an uppercase letter):

> One major difference with other implementations of the well-founded default negation is that
> Flora-2 lets one apply it to formulas that contain variables. Normally, systems either require
> that the formula under `\naf` is ground or they interpret something like `\naf p(?X)` as meaning
> _“not exists `?X` such that `p(?X)` is true”_ — the so-called **Not-Exists semantics**. 

This is what Prolog does with `\+`.

> However, this is not the right semantics in many cases. The right semantics is usually 
> _“there exists `?X` such that `p(?X)` is not true.”_  This semantics is known as the **Exists-Not semantics**.
> Indeed, the standard convention for variables that occur in the rule body but not in the head is existential.
> For instance, if `?X` does not occur in the head of some rule, `p(?X)` in the body of that rule is
> interpreted as `∃?X p(?X)`. Negation should not be treated differently, i.e., `\naf p(?X)` should be
> interpreted as `∃?X \naf p(?X)`. Worse yet, if `?X` does occur in the rule head then it is confusing
> and error-prone to interpret `h(?X) :- \naf p(?X)` as `h(?X) :- \naf ∃?X p(?X)` using the Naf-Exists
> semantics. And without the Naf-Exists semantics, `\naf p(?X)` has no meaning, if `?X` happens to be non-ground.
>
> Flora-2 takes a different approach. For body-only variables that appear under `\naf` the
> semantics is Exists-Not. 

## Vocabulary

**Definite logic program** or **Positive logic program**: A logic program consisting of clauses of the form 

> `a_0 :- a_1, .... , a_m.` 

i.e. Prolog programs without negation-as-failure or otherwise.

**Normal logic program** or **General logic program**: A logic program consisting of clauses of the form

> `a_0 :- a_1, .... , a_m, \+ a_{m+1}, ... \+ a_n.`

where `\+` stands for negation-as-failure (aka. weak negation, default negation).

These are the "Prolog program with negation-as-failure". In the literature, `\+` may also be written as `naf` (clear) or `-` (unclear).

There are also

**Extended logic programs**: Logic programs with two kind of negation, one of which is the "strong" or "explicit" negation. Clauses are of the form

> `l_0 :- l_1, ... , l_m, \+ l_{m+1} , ... , \+ l_n`

This means the clause is formed by literals, some of which may be annotated with the "negation as failure" operator.
The literals `l_0, ... , l_n` may be formed by means of strong negation (often denoted by `~` operator): `l` = `a` or `l` = `~a` (presumably, the
head is neither strongly nor weakly negated). Prolog can't handle those.

## Interpretation<a name="interpretation"></a>

Read `\+ G` as 

- _there is no evidence for `G`_ or 
- _there is no proof for `G`_.

In fact it can also be read as "we really don't know anything about G" since Prolog has only the concept of
"successful positive constructive proof (i.e. with witness (result))" and otherwise "proof failure (and no result)".
One can also read `\+ G` as "continue on this branch only if there is proof failure for G". 

This is not the same as "strong negation" expressing knowledge that "G does not hold".
Instead it is a kind of default reasoning whereby everything that cannot be proven by the program
is assumed to have a special truth value "false by default" or "false unless proven differenty".
One then conflates this truth value with the classical truth value `false` (maybe an error?).
In literatue, the `\+` operator is sometimes written as `naf` (for negation-as-failure) or `~`.

Using this "negation as failure" or "default negation" is often sufficient. Modeling 
some problems, however, demands strong negation (which is not necessarily the negation of classical logic,
as classical logic has undesirable properties, one being the "law of the excluded middle", the other
[the principle of explosion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_explosion). A logic
program that can handle real-world data must be careful to not succumb to those.

An example of when strong negation is useful,
from the _smodels_ manual ([Lparse 1.0 User's Manual](http://www.tcs.hut.fi/Software/smodels/lparse.ps.gz)), p.33:

Suppose that we want to check whether it is safe to cross railroad tracks This could be expressed by the rule:

```
safe :- \+ train.
```

The problem here is that we consider the crossing to be safe if we can't prove that a train is coming.
A more safe approach would be to declare the crossing safe only if we _can_ prove that the train is,
indeed, _not_ coming:

```
safe :- ¬train.
```

In this case, approaches other than Prolog may be needed: Full first-order theorem provers
like [Vampire](http://www.vprover.org/) or 
Answer-Set-Programming systems ("stable model semantics") like
[smodels](http://www.tcs.hut.fi/Software/smodels/) or [Potassco](https://potassco.org/doc/).

## The set "NAF"<a name="the_set_NAF"></a>

- A _positive logic program_ is a set of rules that has no negative subgoals (is this terminology in common use?)
- A _general logic program_ is a set of rules that have both positive and negative subgoals (this terminology _is_ in common use)

If we interprete Negation-as-Failure as defining the set of ground goals for which a Prolog program P
finitely fails after exhaustive, but unsuccessful proof search, then we can draw this tree of subset
relationships, which clarifies the relationship between "NAF" and the "Closed World Assumption".

In this diagram, we assume the program is a "positive program", i.e. it does not itself contain a
`\+` call. (Needs another diagram for that case, TODO). It is also unclear whether "impure" program
constructs can be used. Interaction computing is definitely proscribed.

![Where is the set of NAF](pics/where_is_the_set_naf.svg)

An alternative image. I will have to decide which one to use...

![Where is the set of NAF, alternative image](pics/another_graph_for_naf.svg)

The next in step would be a image that also includes proof that have `\+` itself in the proof tree, once, twice, etc ... 
(that's related to what is called "stratified" and "locally stratified" programs I suppose, to be continued!)

This gives another reading of `\+ Goal`, namely: _"does 'Goal' belong to the set NAF?"_. 

A Prolog program that uses the above principle is said to perform SLDNF proof search (SLD resolution
plus the neagtion as failure rule).

Pointers to pursue from "The Well-Founded Semantics for General Logic Programs"

- Apparently "Clarke's completed database" yields exactly the truth values of SLDNF. 
- The "Closed World Assumption" is due to Reiter (R. Reiter. On closed world databases. In Gallaire and Minker, 
  editors, Logic and Databases, pages 55{76. Plenum Press, New York, 1978.)
- The "generalized closed world assumption" was proposed by Minker to handle disjunctive 
  databases (J. Minker. On indefinite databases and the closed world assumption. In Sixth Conference
  on Automated Deduction, pages 292-308, New York, 1982. Springer-Verlag.) without producing the
  inconsistency typical of the closed world assumption. 

## Non-monotonicity<a name="non_monotonicity"></a>

Negation-as-failure is a "nonomontonic" computation of truth values in that, if the logic program
is expanded by adding positive facts (we can't add negative facts facts to a Prolog program)
some statements formerly `true` may flip to `false`:

```
:- dynamic(q/1).
q(1).
p(X) :- \+ q(X).
```

Then

```
?- p(1).
false.

?- p(2).
true.
```

But if we add a new (and positive) fact `q(2)`, non-monotonicity arises. Not all the statements formerly `true` stay `true`:

```
?- assertz(q(2)).
true.

?- p(2).
false.
```

In fact, in Prolog the problem of having a consistent program (a program that doesn't give both classical
truth values to a statement) is whisked away by only allowing programs that give the value `true` to statements.
All the remaining statements are assumed to be `default false`. However, as seen above, the `\+` allows
one to indirectly give the value `true` to statements by passing through the pool of `default false` statements.

Can we create a inconsistent program? One in which `p(2)` is both `true` and `false`?

```
q(1).
q(2).
p(2).
p(X) :- \+ q(X).
```

Actually not:

```
?- p(2).      
true ;        % p(2) is true, maybe there are other solutions
false.        % No.
```

No, we can't! The success `p(2)` "paints over" the failure of `p(2)` via `q(2)`.  
In Prolog, only success counts, and Prolog actively looks only for success, never for failure.
It's quite "asymmetric".

This can be an effect that is desired or not. See also:

## The meaning of `\+` via fixpoint semantics for "stratified programs"<a name="stratified_programs"></a>

References (see below for links):

- Refer to the course material form Marek Sergot's course for details:
  [Stratified logic programs](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~mjs/teaching/KnowledgeRep491/Stratified_491-2x1.pdf) (PDF)  
- "Towards a Theory of Declarative Knowledge" (Apr, Blair, Walker).

Logic programs with `\+` can be relatively wild if the usage of `\+` is unconstrained. They may run, but if
they succeed or fail, do they really do what one expects?

In order to specify what an (intuitvely compelling) declarative meaning of a normal logic program is, one wants to give a 
model of that logic program, or at least do so for a set of logic programs that have "good" (but not exceedingly restrictive) qualities. 
Then one can meaningfully decide whether the program "works correctly" by comparing its behaviour to the model,
ands decide whether the implementation it is complete and sound relative to that model.

It turns out that there exists a construction of a set of normal logic programs for which there exists a **unique** _minimal supported model_, 
which is built using an iterated fixpoint construction.

Vocabulary:

- **declarative**: one does not want to refer to the actual execution of SLDNF resolution
- **model**: a set of facts (ground atoms) with predicate symbols, function symbols and constants from the program's Herbrand Base such that,
  if all of those ground atoms are labeled _true_ then all the clauses (facts and rules) of the logic program can be labeled _true_ too
  (according to classical logic deduction). This is a **Herbrand model**.
- the model is **minimal**: you cannot remove a fact without making it a non-model
- the model is **supported**: all the facts in the model have predicate symbols that appear in facts or rule heads. Predicate symbols
  that appear in bodies only are not considered for inclusion in the model (one cannot say whether there are any true facts about them).
- the implementation is **complete**: querying the actually implemented program yields all the ground atoms in the model (subject to compromises)
- the implementation is **sound**: querying the actually implemented program never yields a ground atom not in the model (important)

The program must certainly have other conditions: no no-logical predicates and operations, no `->/2`, no `!`.

The program must be such that one can _stratify_ it, i.e. partition the set of predicates into strata such that:

_stratum 0_ is the set of positive predicates, i.e. those which have do not have the _\+_ operator in the body. 
 Inside that set, the predicates can refer to each other. (This stratum may well be empty).

And above that _stratum 1_ to _stratum N_, as required, with:

_stratum k_: The set of predicates that depend positively on predicates in stratum _k_ to _0_, and depend negatively only on
 predicates in stratum _k-1_ to _0_.

A stratification is not unique. The same program can be stratified in multiple ways. The "depends positively on"
and "depends negatively on" relationships among predicates induces a partial ordering relation and a stratification
is a labeling that makes the ordering total.

Pictorially ("dependency graph"), if a predicate is represented by a node in a graph, and the relation
 _"p depends (-) on q"_ is represented by a "fat arrow directed edge" and the relation
 _"p depends (+) on q"_ is represented by a "dashed arrow directed edge", then a stratified program allows the
 graph has to be laid out such that all the dashed arrows point _"not upwards"_ and the fat arrows point _"downwards"_.

![Predicate Graph](pics/predicate_graph.png)

If that is not possible, the logic program (or a subprogram thereof) is not stratified. 

In particular `p :- \+ p` is not stratified.

Note that if there is a cycle of dashed edges, then all the nodes on that cycle must appear in the same stratum. In
fact, the more everything depends positively on everything else, the less strata there are.

If there is a cycle with at least one fat edge in it, stratification will fail. Conversely, in any successful stratification,
a fat edge will not participate in a cycle (as it can only point "downwards", that cycle must have another edge pointing
"upwards", which is forbidden). Thus:

**Lemma** 

> The logic program _P_ is stratified iff the dependency graph for _P_ contains no cycles containing a negative edge.

(Some notes on the fixpoint construction to be added)

### Locally stratified programs

"Local stratification" considers the propositional program derived from a FOL program, whereby clauses
are replaced by all ground instances. The stratify according to the ground atoms of clause heads instead of
predicates. It turns out that in some cases, even if an original program cannot be stratified,
its "locally stratified program" can be. 

Marek Sergot writes in his course material: 

> The generalisation to locally stratified is not particularly useful in practice, but
> there are references to it in the literature, and it can be a very useful device when trying
> to prove, e.g., the existence of a supported minimal model of a logic program/database.

In "Vivid Logic: Knowledge-Based Reasoning with Two Kinds of Negation", Gerd Wagner writes on page 5:

> The principal case of logic programming is the one where programs do not contain negative loops
> (in fact, since standard Prolog systems implement a depth-first proof strategy, they cannot even
> handle positive loops), and thus can be handled efficiently by an interpreter (i.e. an implemented
> inference procedure). These programs are called _weakly wellfounded_ or _locally stratified_.

## A fine point on the shift in meaning of the goal inside an imbricated  _\+_<a name="imbricated_not"></a>

I haven't found a discussion in literature concerning the "shift in meaning" that occurs due to `\+` but it must have been discussed somewhere.

Prolog only admits to to truth values "Prolog True" (signalled by a query that succeeds) and "Prolog False"
(signalled by a query that fails). Arguably there is also a potentially infinite number of out-of-band truth values
signalled by exceptions, but let's not consider these. 
There is an additonal peculiarity in that `fail`/ `failure` /`false` can also signal that the computation failed, for example
because a value was out-of-domain. Let's not consider this either (restricting ourselves to "modeling" rather
than "computation").

Let a "positive proof" be one which encounters no `\+` during proof search. 

Take the query `p`. Then:

The proof for `q` is based on positive proofs only:

- If `p` succeeds, the meaning is _"there is evidence for `p`, and `p` is strongly true"_, i.e. there is indeed at least one proof of `p`.
- If `p` fails the meaning is _"there is no evidence for `p`, and `p` is weakly false"_, i.e. all the attempts at proving `p` failed and we assume that `p` takes on truth value `false` as default (closed world assumption).

Suppose the proof for `p` involves a subgoal `q` wrapped by `\+`, and the proof of `q` is a positive proof. Then:

- If `q` succeeds, the meaning is _"there is evidence for `q`, and `q` is strongly true"_.
   - And thus `p` fails, but a reasonable meaning of that failure would be _"`p` is strongly false"_ (because `q` is strongly true).
   - This is different from the meaning of _"`p` is weakly false"_ that is assumed (and implemented: you can override a failed `p` with another proof that succeeds).
- If `q` fails, the meaning is _"there is no evidence for `q`, and `q` is weakly false"_.
   - And thus `p` succeeds, but a reasonable meaning of that success would be _"`p` is weakly true"_ (because `q` is strongly false).
   - Again, this is different from the meaning of _"`p` is strongly true"_ that is assumed (and implemented: you cannot override a successful `p` at all).
   
The "weakness" attribute (default assumption for a truth value) in Prolog only exists for the truth value `false`. However, it 
seems an application of `\+` should switch it from the subgoal's truth value to the complementary goal's truth value.

One could imagine a logic programming language with more truth values than "true" and "default false" to
make the above clearer, or even consistent. It wouldn't be Prolog though. 

![some extended logical values](pics/some_extended_logical_values.svg)

## Logic programming with extended logics<a name="extended_logics"></a>

Belnap has a four-valued logic that abandons the pretense of classical logic at global consistency and determinate
truth values `true` or `false` for every statement (so the idea of having "proofs by contradiction" is no longer applicable,
but both the philosophy and the actual maintenance of large databases become viable). It uses the truth values
 `true`, `false`, `both`, `none` (arranged on a lattice).

## A Byrd Box view of the `\+` operator<a name="byrd_box_view_of_not_operator"></a>

One can consider `\+ p` as a recabling of the Byrd Box for `p` as depicted below:

![Byrd Box view of not](pics/byrd_box_view_of_negation.png)

Note that there are no "redos" of the enclosed `p`: If `p` fails, we get out via the outer box's "success" port (traditionally
and awkwardly called the "exit" port) and the outer box is not re-entered by the "redo" path coming from the right. If `p` succeeds,
we get out via the "fail" port towards the left and that's it. In bot cases, we pass through a "fail" port and roll back any 
bindings that p may have performed.

## Implementing `\+` with `->/2` (and vice-versa)<a name="implementing_not_with_arrow"></a>

 `\+` and `->` are interchangeable:

On the one hand, as long as you can deal with calling the `If` part twice (otherwise you need the cut, too):

```
my_if_then_else(_If,_Then,Else) :- call(If),call(Else).
my_if_then_else(If,Then,_Else)  :- \+ call(If),call(Then). 
```

On the other hand:

```
my_if_then_else(Goal) :- call(Goal) -> fail ; true.
``` 

The `->/2` is subject to floundering, similarly to `\+` and may make the program unsound (see below).

This is about "stable models" and "Answer Set Programming". "Disjunctive Databases" are logic programming
languages which allow no function symbols but do allow clauses with heads in which an "or" logical connective appears.

Abstract:

> An important limitation of traditional logic programming as a knowledge representation tool, in
> comparison with classical logic, is that logic programming does not allow us to deal directly with
> incomplete information. In order to overcome this limitation, we extend the class of general logic
> programs by including classical negation, in addition to negation-as-failure. The semantics of
> such extended programs is based on the method of stable models. The concept of a disjunctive
> database can be extended in a similar way. We show that some facts of commonsense knowledge
> can be represented by logic programs and disjunctive databases more easily when classical negation
> is available. Computationally, classical negation can be eliminated from extended programs by a
> simple preprocessor. Extended programs are identical to a special case of default theories in the
> sense of Reiter.

Abstract:

> A general logic program is a set of rules that have both positive and negative subgoals. 
> It is common to view a deductive database as a general logic program consisting
> of rules (Intensional Ddatabase, IDB) sitting above elementary relations (Extensional
> Database, EDB, facts). It is desirable to associate one Herbrand model with a program and think 
> of that model as the "meaning of the program," or its "declarative semantics." Ideally, queries
> directed to the program would be answered in accordance with this model.
> 
> Recent research indicates that some programs do not have a "satisfactory" _total_ model; for such programs,
> the question of an appropriate _partial_ model arises. We introduce _unfounded_ sets and _well-founded partial models_,
> and define the well-founded semantics of a program to be its well-founded partial model. If the
> well-founded partial model is in fact a total model, we call it the _well-founded_ model. We show that the
> class of programs possessing a total well-founded model properly includes previously studied classes of
> "stratified" and "locally stratified" programs. We also compare our method with other proposals in the
> literature, including Clark's "program completion," Fitting's and Kunen's 3-valued interpretations of it,
> and the "stable models" of Gelfond and Lifschitz.

> Present paper surveys several formal and axiomatic methods to deal with the problem of negation in PROLOG. Furthermore, a brief philosophical
> account is also mentioned.

> The reason why the negation is problematic in Prolog is the fact that “it is not possible to express negative information with pure
> Horn clauses” as Prolog’s resolution works by utilizing Horn clauses. In other words, it has been remarked that “a logic program is
> a set of definite Horn clauses”.

The following approaches are proposed:

- Implement a four-valued logic with ordered truth values: F ≤ U ≤ T ≤ N, with U meaning "undefined" and F "floundering on negation", as 
  described by James Andrews in _"A logical semantics for depth-first Prolog with ground negation"_
- Extend programs with classical negation so that they include negative information explicitly. The author says _As a result, there will be two types of queries which do not succeed. One type does not succeed since it fails and the other does not succeed since its negation succeeds._ This means abandoning the Prolog model based on resolution and passing to the Answer-Set-Programming model based on Stable Models of Gelfond and Lifschitz.
- Extending the Models for Negation: As proposed by James Harland in _A Kripke-like Model for Negation as Failure_.
