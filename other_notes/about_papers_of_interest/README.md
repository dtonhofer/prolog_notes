     _lecture notes written in 1974. The preface describes the goals of the book in the following terms: 'This book investigates the_
     _application of logic to problem-solving and computer programming. It assumes no previous knowledge of these fields, and may_
     _be appropriate therefore as an introduction to logic. the theory of problem-solving, and computer programming"._

   - From the book: 
     > Several books cover the basics of LP but focus mostly on the Prolog language with its incomplete
     > control strategy and non-logical features. At the same time, there is generally a lack of accessible 
     > yet comprehensive collections of articles covering the key aspects in declarative LP. 
     > These aspects include, among others, well-founded vs. stable model semantics for negation, 
     > constraints, object-oriented LP, updates, probabilistic LP, and evaluation methods, including top-down vs. bottom-up, and tabling.
     > The goal of this book is to help fill in the previously mentioned void in the LP literature. It offers 
     > a number of overviews on key aspects of LP that are suitable for researchers and practitioners as well as 
     > graduate students.
